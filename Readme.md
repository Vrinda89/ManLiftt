## About

    Kotlin is the chosen language for this project development since Google is officially supporting
    kotlin and soon will be shifted to Dart. Kotlin keeps the class clean with minimal lines of code
    as compared with java.

    This project is developed in MVVM Architecture.
    Dagger is used for dependency injection so that depended object is ready during the runtime of
    the application.

    Datas are populated in UI using databinding method.
